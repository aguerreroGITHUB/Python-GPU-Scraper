# Amazon Graphics Cards Scraper
A simple web scraper script that will request the prices for an in-code list of amazon links.

It is not something too hard, but with a little of imagination you can figure out the potential this programming branch has.

I think the most powerful use of this is turning this script into a windows task that executes everyday or even plugging it into a raspberry/arduino so you make sure it runs daily and it's always plugged in.
